# IRC-client
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication in the form of text. 
The chat process works on a client/server networking model. 
IRC clients are computer programs that users can install on their system or web based applications 
-running either locally in the browser or on a 3rd party server. 
These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients.
[1] IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels,
[2] but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages
[3] as well as chat and data transfer,
[4] including file sharing.
